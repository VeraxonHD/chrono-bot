# Chrono Lite
Welcome to Chrono Lite! This is a very lightweight bot made in about an hour, with the purpose of automatically converting timezones and getting others' timezones on request.

Unlike other bots, it's non-intrusive and easy to use! Integrate the power of https://lmgtfy.com/?q=time+zone+converter into your Discord chat bar!

Thanks to my mate Cameron for reading shit out off the screen and pointing out a dumb bug *even though you don't even know how to code. thanks chief.*
