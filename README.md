# Chrono - The Bot for all your time and calendar needs.
Chrono is a fully-fledged version if its' [younger brother](https://github.com/VeraxonHD/chrono-bot/tree/lite), chrono-lite.

The lite version is great for hosting on your own, and forking to make your own changes. However, for the best effect, I reccomend getting Chrono proper, as it has many more features designed to help guilds and users much more.

Unlike other bots, it's non-intrusive and easy to use! Integrate the power of https://lmgtfy.com/?q=time+zone+converter into your Discord chat bar!

Check out the [TRELLO](https://trello.com/b/fTZ62kNU/chrono-discord-bot) for a roadmap and list of updates and planned features!

Thanks to my mate Cameron for reading shit out off the screen and pointing out a dumb bug *even though you don't even know how to code. thanks chief.*
